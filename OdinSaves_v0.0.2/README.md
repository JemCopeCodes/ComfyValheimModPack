# OdinSaves
  * Your game will now save your character more often!
  * This means less annoyances if you crash or bug out!
  * Defaults to saving every 300s, configurable! (Game default and maximum is every 1200s).
  * Saves your current position as your logout point (defaults to true).
  * Shows a message when saving (also configurable).
    
**Use at your own risk!**

This mod simply triggers after the existing game's save code and performs the same check and save functionality.

However, game crashes or other issues during game saves can always be a cause for corruption and so you should make a
backup of your character saves files often.

Your character save files (in Windows 10) can be found at:
  * C:\Users\<YourWindowsUsernameHere>\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\characters
