# ComfyValheimModPack

When you upload to [Thunderstore](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/) mods must be uploaded as a zip file with an icon, manifest, README, and .dll at minimum. This repo contains this setup so that we can easily update the [Comfy Valheim modpack.](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ComfyMods/ComfyValheimPack/)

The ModPack is mostly a list of dependencies, but some mods were packed into it directly (such as custom loading screens so I could pick the screens).

Some mod folders are created from mods that allowed upload permission but they are not mine. Please check with the individual creators in those cases.
